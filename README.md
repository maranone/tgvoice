Telegram bot that acts as a voice/text interface to Claude or Codex. You send it a voice message or text from
  your phone, it transcribes the audio (Whisper), passes it to Claude/Codex CLI, and sends the response back as both
  text and a spoken voice message (Kokoro TTS). Runs locally on your machine, no cloud APIs except Telegram itself.
